## About This Repository
This GitHub repo is a shared project by **Erik Duthiers** and **Irene Berros**, where we embark on an exciting journey of building AI agents and exploring the wonders of artificial intelligence. From smart assistants to automation tools, if it involves AI, it's fair game!

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here
- **AI Agents** ðŸ¤– â€“ Because doing things manually is so last century.
- **Machine Learning Experiments** ðŸ§ª â€“ Some will succeed, some will explode. Science!
- **Cool AI Projects** ðŸŽ© â€“ The kind of stuff that makes people say, "Whoa, you built that?"

## Got an Idea? Bring It On! ðŸ’¡
This is an open space for creativity. If you have a wild AI project idea, let us know! The crazier, the better.

We take no responsibility for any accidental sentient AI that decides to take over the world. Use at your own risk. ðŸ˜†

Stay tuned for more AI magic! âœ¨
