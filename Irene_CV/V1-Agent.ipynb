      "\n",
      "### 1. **Highlight Generative AI Experience**\n",
      "   - **Action**: Emphasize the experience with generative AI in the CV. The project descriptions should explicitly mention the design and development aspects of generative AI models.\n",
      "   - **Example Improvement**: In the \"Sales Coach Assistant for BBVA Gen AI\" project, add details about the model architecture used, any specific algorithms implemented, and the outcomes of the project in terms of performance metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Emphasize Optimization and Fine-Tuning Skills**\n",
      "   - **Action**: Include specific examples of how Erik has optimized or fine-tuned AI models in previous projects.\n",
      "   - **Example Improvement**: Add a bullet point under relevant projects that describes any techniques used for model optimization, such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, or performance evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Technical Guidance and Mentorship**\n",
      "   - **Action**: If Erik has experience mentoring or providing technical guidance to peers or junior team members, this should be included.\n",
      "   - **Example Improvement**: Add a section or bullet point that describes any mentorship roles or instances where Erik provided technical guidance, such as leading a project team or conducting training sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Strengthen Communication and Presentation Skills**\n",
      "   - **Action**: Include specific examples of communication and presentation skills, especially in cross-functional settings.\n",
      "   - **Example Improvement**: Mention any presentations given to stakeholders, workshops led, or documentation created that showcases Erik's ability to communicate complex AI concepts effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Incorporate R Programming Language**\n",
      "   - **Action**: If Erik has any experience with R, it should be included. If not, consider taking a course or working on a project that utilizes R to meet the job requirements.\n",
      "   - **Example Improvement**: If Erik has experience with R, add it to the \"Programming & Tools\" section. If not, consider adding a note about plans to learn R or relevant coursework.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Expand on Data Analysis and Insights Generation**\n",
      "   - **Action**: Provide more details on how Erik has generated insights from data analysis in previous roles.\n",
      "   - **Example Improvement**: In the \"Gas Logistic Analyst\" role, elaborate on how the pricing curve calculations led to actionable insights for decision-making in deal-making processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Showcase Collaboration with Cross-Functional Teams**\n",
      "   - **Action**: Highlight specific instances of collaboration with cross-functional teams in the CV.\n",
      "   - **Example Improvement**: Add a bullet point under each relevant project that describes how Erik collaborated with other departments or teams, emphasizing the impact of this collaboration on project outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. **Refine the Summary Section**\n",
      "   - **Action**: Update the summary section to reflect the key skills and experiences that align with the job description.\n",
      "   - **Example Improvement**: Rewrite the summary to include phrases like \"Experienced in generative AI model design and development,\" \"Proven track record in optimizing AI models,\" and \"Strong communicator with experience in cross-functional collaboration.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### 9. **Add Relevant Certifications or Courses**\n",
      "   - **Action**: If Erik has completed any additional certifications or courses related to generative AI, machine learning, or data analysis, these should be included.\n",
      "   - **Example Improvement**: List any relevant online courses or certifications that focus on generative AI or advanced machine learning techniques.\n",
